<!-- Project Description -->
<h4 align="center">A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a> mod made for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/">Repentance</a> extension.</h4>

## Features

- When the item is found, a message will be displayed near the player.
- The message will not disappear unless the player moves to another room.

> [!WARNING]
> The player may not feel comfortable with the consequences of this mod.
>
> Due to the game's design, the items in each room are only loaded the first time you enter. Consequently, the mod simulates entering the
> treasure room to inspect the items and then returns to the initial room. This process not only marks the treasure room on the map but also 
> leaves the path back to the initial room marked and its door permanently open, meaning you will no longer need a key to access it.

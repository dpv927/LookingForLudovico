<!-- Project Description -->
<h4 align="center">A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a> mod made for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/">Repentance</a> extension.</h4>

## Features

- When the item is found, a message will be displayed near the player.
- The message will not disappear unless the player moves to another room.
- The message is now shown above the player so that it does not overlap with the dialogue that will appear in a future mod of mine.

## Fixes (Version 1.5)

- The map issue has been resolved. Now, the treasure room and its adjacent rooms don't show as visited on the map.
- The door issue has also been resolved. Now that the room is marked as not visited, you will need a key to open the door (if it requires one), just like in normal gameplay.

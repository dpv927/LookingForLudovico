    <description>This mod will tell you if the Item 'The Ludovico Technique' is present at any treasure room of a level. The source code of this mod can be found at [url=https://github.com/dpv927/LookingForLudovico]GitHub[/url].

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] When the item is found, a message will be displayed near the player and Isaac will do the thumbs up emote.
[*] The message will not disappear unless the player moves to another room.
[/list]

[h1]Fixes (Version 1.6)[/h1]
[list]
[*] Somehow, some adjacent rooms to the treasure rooms still showed up in the map. This is now fixed.
[*] This mod caused the golden treasure room in Greed mode to stay open and does not seem to be a primitive solution. Therefore, Greed mode won't be supported by this mod until this issue is solved.

    <description>This mod will tell you if the Item 'The Ludovico Technique' is present at any treasure room of a level. The source code of this mod can be found at [url=https://github.com/dpv927/LookingForLudovico]GitHub[/url].

[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*] When the item is found, a message will be displayed near the player.
[*] The message will not disappear unless the player moves to another room.
[*] The message is now shown above the player so that it does not overlap with the dialogue that will appear in a future mod of mine.
[*] Major fix: The map issue has been resolved. Now, the treasure room and its adjacent rooms don't show as visited on the map.
